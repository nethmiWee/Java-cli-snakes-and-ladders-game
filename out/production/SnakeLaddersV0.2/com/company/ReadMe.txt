The game follows the basic principles of snakes and ladders.
Where players must reach 150th square to win.

The positions are shown on the grid visually and actions are 
displayed on the console, for instance, storms, stickies, 
boosters, snakes and ladders.

Players are capable of choosing amount of players in the game and
to roll dice for greater interactivity.

1.) Choose the amount of players. The assignment specifies 3 so
this can be chosen.
2) Game can be exited with "E" or "e" at choosing player number or during rolling.
3.) The players must roll a 1 or a 6.

    to start.
5.) The game is then played, with user entering to roll dice.
6.) Special squares cause different events.
